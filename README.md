# ![Tortle Header Image](./Icon.png) Tortle - A tiny utility for Tor

<br />
### Description:
__Tortle is a small litle utility for Mac OS X that can easily enable and disable Tor.__

<br />
### Usage:
To use Tortle, simply type `tortle` followed by `-e`/`--enable` or `-d`/`--disable`. The arguments should be pretty self explanatory. O_o

<br />
### Notes:
I just threw together the Tortle icon (see attributions below), so it looks kind of strange. If you would like to make an icon for Tortle, please do and email me at <thrifus@gmail.com>
